# ðŸ›µ React Vespa v1 (Alpha)

> This readme is temporal and everything else, it is only for the request of the Js community members who wanted to contribute to this that it is out this immature, later changes to standardize things will be made, including a documentary readme for the library and a standard project setup!

## A Little bit on the idea

React reveal scroll animation library provides out of the box animations for react but it's last maintained 6 years ago, and quite only one with out of the box animation approach, therefore this poses a chance for someting new and refreshed to fit in modern react developers workflow, hence vespa, vespa tends to provide almost all react reveal out of the box animations and props or functionalities and more on top of that to be the ideal updated option around.
We could achieve this using builtin broswer intersection obeserver api or build on top of a libary like framer motion or scroll out, still evaluating. Feel free to open a new issues or discussion on this whole thing or contrbute directly, welcome!
